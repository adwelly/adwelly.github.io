I'm learning to steno, which means typing using a peculiar keyboard with a
 minimum of twenty-six keys. My first one had twenty eight, and my second (that
 arrived today) has an additional eight keys. Here they are:

 There are various reasons for this effort, but the main one from my point of view is that
despite a long involvement in IT, my keyboarding skills are at best -- catastrophically bad.
I took  an online test before starting this and was not surprised to discover that
I hunt and peck on a QWERTY keyboard at around thirty WPM, and I'm inaccurate to boot!

I've made one or two attempts to improve on this over the years, but without much
success. When I decided to try again a few months back, I wondered if there was
any serious alternative to the usual QWERTY, DVORAK, and COLEMAK arrangements we normally
see.

It turns out that there is. Steno has been around for a long time but it's always been
a skill that you could only learn by spending a lot of money on kit and even more at a
 training school.  In the old days, reaching a professional standard, a sustained two hundred and
 Forty WPM, could guarantee a job for life transcribing court cases or captioning films and
 TV. Things have changed thanks to the [Open Steno project](http://www.openstenoproject.org).
 It's now possible to pick up a steno friendly keyboard quite
cheaply and the skills and software can be acquired simply by investing your time. So
It represents a great opportunity for someone who spends a lot time with keyboards.

Steno works by allowing the user to enter words and phrases a syllable at a time using chords
. So the sentence  'A cup of coffee' is five chords rather than fifteen key strokes. There are
also hundreds of short cuts -- briefs, that save even more time. I'm not planning to reach professional
standards, but in my case a mere doubling in speed would be a huge payoff. I've had about
twenty hours of drills, which is enough to find my way around the keyboard. Now it's
time who of to start using steno for real stuff.

I'm blogging, tweeting, and emailing with steno now. Slowly to be sure, but the job eventually gets done. Watch this space.
