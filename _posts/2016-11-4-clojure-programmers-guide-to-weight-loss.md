title: The Clojure programmer's guide to weight loss
---

I am an expert at losing weight. Over the course of a long professional life,  I've lost and then regained hundreds of pounds. Of course, as I've got older it's become easier to gain rather than lose them, and a little over a year ago my Dr. looked at my latest blood test results and shook his head. Things had gone beyond the mere cosmetic and my long term difficulties were now a serious threat to my health.

The problem is, that although it's clear that being overweight is a risk, there are not very many good treatments for it. The one very effective drug, Reductil, was taken off the market some time ago as it caused blood pressure problems. Simply demanding more self control doesn't work in an environment where food is cheap and plentiful. That sounds like an excuse even as I type it, but it's more of an evidence based argument. Doctors have been asking for more self control for a long time and yet there's an ever increasing number of people who have exactly the same problem I do.

Fortunately for me — just as I was contemplating yet another attempt at living exclusively on steak and eggs, [The Obesity Code](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Obesity-Code-unlocking-secrets-weight-ebook/dp/B01BU9JZKA/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1478250921&sr=1-1&keywords=obesity+code) was published. It's quite an involved book, but it pointed very strongly to a conclusion. It's not just what you eat, but when, and how frequently. Fasting, it suggests, is the secret to weight control.

Rich Hickey, the author of Clojure, has [talked](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) of a very subtle distinction between things that are simple (not complicated) and things that are easy (familiar and practiced). For example, buying a tin of beans from the local shop is simple, hand over some cash and walk out with the food. Driving to the local shop is easy -  e.g.  something we often do, but it's far from simple. A UK driver has to obey hundreds of rules and regulations not to mention the complexity of the car itself.

Losing weight by fasting is simple rather than easy. Simple because you simply skip a few meals. It's not a familiar process though, and I occasionally notice waves of hunger — always temporary —  coffee helps. Despite the discomfort, you can get used to it.

I've lost 32 pounds since March 2016, and though there's still some way to go, it does seem that fasting might turn out to be the simple way to lose weight. I can recommend the book and the idea.
